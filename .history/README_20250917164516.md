# Legacy API Modernization: Weather Station Example

## Problem

- The original system used a legacy C++ program (weather_station.exe) to simulate weather data.
- The technology was outdated and not easily accessible for modern web or mobile clients.

## Solution

- Built a REST API using Node.js and Express to act as a bridge (adapter) between modern clients and the legacy C++ executable.
- The REST API executes the legacy program, parses its output, and returns the data as JSON.
- This approach enables gradual migration and integration with new systems, without rewriting the legacy codebase.

## Migration Strategy

- Wrap legacy functionality with a RESTful interface.
- Allow both legacy and modern systems to coexist during the transition.
- Future updates can replace the legacy backend with a new implementation, while keeping the REST API unchanged for clients.

## Tech Stack Used

- C++ (legacy weather simulation)
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
- Express (REST API framework for Node.js)
- child_process.exec (to run the legacy executable from Node.js)

## How It Works

1. Client sends HTTP request to REST API endpoint.
2. REST API runs the legacy C++ executable.
3. Output from the executable is parsed and returned as JSON.

This pattern can be applied to other legacy systems (including CORBA, SOAP, or old HTTP APIs) by updating the bridge logic to communicate with the appropriate backend technology.
